# PrintJS
## How to use?
You can use single command `print(var);` to get output
For more extended output, you can use `print('iRandom info','blah blah blah');`.
'i' in the start means type of the output + accent color. You can setup that in PrtCol variable (type should be one symbol).
after 'i', go title of the output. Its colored with accent color, no user firstly focus on that. The second argument of function (in that case 'blah blah blah') its the description of the output, main content.
There are pre-added exceptons, like `print('!Error', 'notice me!');`. In that case is used `console.error();`.

Please, dont judge also my shit english, i know its bad
